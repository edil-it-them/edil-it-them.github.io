One of the main difficulties was that there are no publicly available official statistics on women‚Äôs murders. So I scraped more than 54000 criminal news articles to understand the femicide patterns in Kyrgyzstan. We identified around 80 words and sentences in accordance with femicide criteria. Then I created a Python script that converts them into flexible regex patterns to fit the complex structures of the Russian language. It let me find more than 3000 news and press releases that covered the women‚Äôs murders."}]},{"level":"4","next":"AR","gif":"d3js","text":"How Kyrgyz parliamentarians change their political parties.","tech":"Python, JS, D3, scrollama","awards":"<a target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù href=https://gijn.org/2020/09/03/data-journalism-top-10-tracking-police-accountability-racism-and-housing-chinas-hidden-prison-camps/>Top-10 by GIJN</a>","slides":[{"text":"Members of Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs parliament often choose their political party by how well its agenda aligns with their personal goals rather than their political values.
